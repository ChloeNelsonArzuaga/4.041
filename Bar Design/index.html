      <h1>Project Breif</h1>
      <p>
        This project aims to create a new chocolate bar through the use of additive manufactureing. Currently chocolate bars are limited to shapes created by prefabricated molds. This limits the interactions and expereinces people can have with their chocolate bars. By using a 3D printer, different flavors can be deposited in specific areas of the bar. This project aims to design a bar that utlizes this advantage to create new flavor interactions. This project also aims to challenge the traditional flavors that accompany chocolate. Through molecular gastronomy, typically irregular flavors will be chosen as additions to the bar. The current flavor pairing is guerye cheese and black tea. As well as being a good aromatic match, these flavors will also serve an aestetic role in the chocolate bar as parts of the bar flavored with cheese or tea will be visibly lighter or darker.
